    "\n",
    "### Assignment 3: List Slicing\n",
    "\n",
    "Print the first five elements, the last five elements, and the elements from index 5 to 15 of the list created in Assignment 1.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Assignment 12: List Zipping\n",
    "\n",
    "Create two lists of the same length. Use the `zip` function to combine these lists into a list of tuples and print the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 13: List Reversal\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function that takes a list and returns a new list with the elements in reverse order. Print the original and reversed lists.\n",
